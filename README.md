# tictactoe-java-console

## Introduction

A game of [TicTacToe](https://github.com/AshleyByeUK/tictactoe-java-core) that can be played in the console.
Features include Human vs Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer modes. The computer player can be
configured for easy and hard difficulties.

## Requirements

This project was written using OpenJDK 11. To run this project, you will need to have a compatible version of the
JDK installed. The JDK can be obtained from the following links:

- [OpenJDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/)

You can also use your operating system's native or third-party package managers to obtain the JDK. Whilst this game 
has not been tested with older versions of Java, you may find that versions as old as JDK 8 are sufficient.

## To Play

There are several ways that you can play TicTacToe. First, you'll need to clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:AshleyByeUK/tictactoe-java-console.git`

You can then use Gradle to run the game or to build a JAR file. The following sections explain how to do this and
assume you are in the root directory of the project.

### Run with Gradle

To run with Gradle, execute the following command:

`./gradlew --console plain run`

You can omit the `--console plain` flag, but you will have to put up with Gradle build information being displayed
in the user interface. This is also quite slow and game play is jittery.

### Run as a JAR file

To build a JAR file, execute the following command:

`./gradlew jar`

This will build a JAR file in the root directory of the project. You can then run the JAR file as follows:

`java -jar build/tictactoe-java-console.jar`

Game play using this method is much smoother.

## Testing

The test suite includes long running tests. These are enabled in the Gradle `testSlow` task.

For example, execute all tests, including long running tests with Gradle:

```
./gradlew testSlow
```

Conversely, to execute all tests, excluding long running tests with Gradle:

```
./gradlew test
```

It can also generate code coverage reports:

```
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

Test reports are generated in both XML and HTML format and are located in the following directory, relative to the
project root directory:

```
build/reports/jacoco/test
```

To open the HTML test reports, type the following (on macOS):

```
open build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```

## Cleaning Up

You can clean up the files and directories created by Gradle with the following command:

`./gradlew clean`
